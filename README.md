# TabCrawler
A web crawler to grab guitar tabs and display them nicely

---

I'm using this as an example project to learn the Python library [Scrapy](http://scrapy.org/).
The goal is to download tabs from [Ultimate-Guitar](http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/) and display them in a nicer format. I'd also like to download chord sheets from the site and convert them to tabs. 

At this point, the web crawler is able to download the content of one page from [Ultimate-Guitar](http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/); however, it is a proof-of-concept.
